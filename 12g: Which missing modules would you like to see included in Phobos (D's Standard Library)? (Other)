I don't know.
std.crypto, datetime format
std.net.http std.net.sctp stdx.net.http.oauth
std.immutable
binary pack/unpack http://code.dlang.org/packages/pack-d and xattrs support
std.decimal should include decimal128, this type is used in mongo and is very helpful
would add more but inclusion in phobos + lack of versioning means API freeze and lack of progress
numeric and matrix
Repository interfaces
std.plot
XML
please keep it small and generic instead of putting everything that's doable as library in it
And so many more!
Common widget set useful for Desktop and Mobile
std.container.queue, std.container.stack, better std.signals
Better compression modules
Put some http & GUI lib already
Good building blocks: DB, Serialization for implementations to share
non-experimental logging
All these are good but they would be fine as DUB modules as well.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html
a proper test library
std.net (http + smtp + URI parsing)
std.crypto
std.build (dub as a library)
std.stream, std.peg (i.e. Pegged in phobos)
std.net.httpserver - std.d.compiler - std.reactive/rx/observable
std.logger out of experimental
I don't care what's stdlib vs third-party lib, as long as there's a good package manager that, unlike dub, is fully separated from project building.
Windowing, event loop is druntime not Phobos
std.plot
Parsing and lexing modulw
Networking
std.http
STD.logging
Improvements to parallelism
std.stream. how long has it been now???
std.actual_containers
better protable dynamic link library support;   runtime code loading/changing (maybe compiler, tool stuff?)
As you can see, I like a "batteries included" philosophy. However, it's not a big issue, since there are several good 3rd party packages available, and dub makes it pretty easy to fetch and build.
Ssh
simple http server
std.simd
std.debug
Mocking
Better HTTPÂ support
cryptography (a standard way to bind to another library that just works is fine)
std.yaml, std.logging
encryption library
asio - async io like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asio_C%2B%2B_library
Http
More range and metaprogramming utilities
std.io 
Better, more complete containers (not necessarily @nogc), a better socket solution, and an @safe replacement for std.mmfile.
Concurrent containers such as ConcurrentDictionary<TKey,TValue> from C#
std.database should interop with a CTFE predicate DSL
std.dom
multithreading utilities
stb.build, to use rdmd or even a compiled binary for building. I want to write my build script in D, not JSON or similar
std.io, leave the rest to dub
Memory friendly associative arrays
