Too nervous
1) i need step-by-step manual to start. 2) i dismotivated by how long PR approved
Already involved in other open source projects usurping time
I am not a compiler or language person but a highly specialized end user
don't want to, watched development for a long time, something just bothers me
linux centered
low experience prgramming in general
N/a
Impression that PRs are often not merged or it takes ages
I use mercurial
I dislike GitHub itself for its policies.
I am along time lurker but want to get more into D
Not good enough for the task.
my 2-3 tries to improve the documentation by just copying great forum hints were turned down for little things like blanks herer and empty lines there (and dfmt did not work the "required" way
i don't think i know enough about D to be useful
Working on D directly is too out of the way for my needs.  If there was a well-developed machine learning library, I would contribute because the addition of new statistical methods would directly benefit my work.
Just starting learning how to use GitHub
I feel more competent to contribute to the language in other ways.
i tried before but the setup was too difficulty on Windows
I'm interested in using D as a langauge but not so much on working on it. It's not that I wouldn't it's just that I would rather use it for things I'm more interested in
I am boycotting Github due to business practices and refuse to use their website
My overall programming skill level is far behind the community average.
Never created a pull request before! Only every done commits to my own repositories.
I'm focused on other projects and am unsure if I can solve the problems projects have
Uncertainty
I try not to make too many changes until my current changes have received some attention.
