web? more than 15 years ago I think.
stumbled upon it, after years of wishing a Lang like it existed, in a sea of corporate controlled other languages.    I found it, and I love it.   Just wish I could find a job doing it as my primary language day to day.

Looking for better languages than C++
On a bookshelf in a computer store. I saw Andrei's book and thought, "That's a silly name for a language! I should leaf through the book."  And I was hooked. 
A friend of mine told me that it existed. I had like one year work experience back then. I checked the webpage and got curious.
