I think we should shut down the forum and switch to blogs. Mostly because of the feedback I am getting from non-D programmers. They pick up information which is misleading.
Nothing. I can find what I need.
Nothing it's the best language website I've ever used.
Third party Javascript
Visual design. When I opened it for the first time my first impression was: "this site wasn't updated in a least 15 years".
 
Nothing special
Not as eye candy as other programming language sites.
I do not typically visit the homepage
Nothing.
I think overall it's difficult to convey the full "personality" of the language in a concise way.
Nothing, it is fine.
#
It needs polishing.   The site is not as exciting as other languages home pages.    I think there should be a Conscious effort in rebrand nding, new logos, new layout, re-wording of content.   Perhaps a sales/marketing consultant should be brought in.   Let’s let experts do what they do best.   D has the technical down perfect,  it just needs  work on the social/human side of things.    
The forums could be better
too much text
I don't know.
Missing tutorials for common IDEs
Personally I preferred earlier versions centered on content more than presentation/marketing
I have serious problems accessing all of or parts of dlang.org during local daytime, it usually works at night. Default Google DNS cannot locate subdomains such as wiki.
More success stories, more user engagement, more fun and welcoming screen (perhaps containing nice graphics).
It's too much like a sales website. I prefer the old style with the information laid out clearly instead of small boxes of salesy text.
Organización de la documentación
nothing
many topics difficult to find from toppage
 
not a lot, doesn't look very modern
For me the problem with the website has not really been the design but the lack of clear and enabling content
Lacking of D-man!
Lack of non-industry examples i.e. projects like onedrive aren't shown - again a nitpick.
Don't really visit it.. what for? I go to the forums directly.
don't know, don't really care for the site, I only used the forum and documentation
The forum software is very bad
N/A
The visual look is still "simple". Though I have no real idea how to improve it.
nothing in mind
The web site is actually not half bad, no complaints, or atleast i am unqualified to complain.
The second half of https://dlang.org, the self-ads should be removed
Really haven't looked in a while.
nothing
Nothing in particular
* mention dlang slack in dlang.org
Information at the top is okay, information at the bottom (actual strengths of D) and even headers such as "Contribute" are not likely to be read as most visitors don't scroll down when glancing over a new page. Perhaps move to a separate "Features" or "Strengths" page?  The initially visible part of the page should be where the most important information and message to convince newcomers is at. Everything more to the bottom is likely to be ignored. Next to that, the top should contain information that is often needed by most visitors, such as existing developers, including the documentation, but this is already the case.  The listing of partners is nice, but takes away a lot of real estate for little benefit; people that find this relevant are usually already semi-convinced to start using it and would likely click through to another page contains this information if necessary, so a separate page for these may be more appropriate?
The repetitive nature offeedabk responses in the Forum section.
Not sure
Scattered and out of date information
Since I "discovered" that I can search within dlang.org, even selecting scope of search, I'm happy: Well done, just the front page is not my entry point, and it's a matter of taste; to me it looks a little bit undecided who is the addressee and what it wants to tell (which seems to be all) and that's to much on a single page IMO, thus it leaves an impression of patchwork 
I often click "Learn" to go to the Learn forum. But this link leads to the tour. Then, in the tour, the top navigation bar changes and it's even harder to find the Learn forum.
I would go with simpler design
Not much - it is really good now. It used to be a bit harder to guide friends to the right downloads or articles on its use, but this has really improved
Nothing worth mentioning
nothing
You need better examples for newcomers. Many would think that the current examples have a weird syntax.
more focus on code examples/language
Examples that are way too complex for novices
The information flow can be very densely packed and it's difficult to discover up to date information on certain features of the language.
The forums seemed to be poisoned with people arguing about the same old stuff. Really just want to see posts by Walter and Aandrei 
Looks like a website from the 80s
Forum underdeveloped.
The language and the site should be more aimed for simpler tasks, so the community can build new software using it. Everybody knows it's very good for cool esoteric usages, like CTFE or template metaprogramming, but the large amount of people just want to write their basic shit in some nice language, and there's no real incentive to doing this in D compared to Python/c++/js/java or w/e they know right now
While informative, the site is not as visually polished as something like "spring.io".  Functionally this is not important, but having a polished website helps impress people new to the language and capture their attention.
Terrible code examples using confusing language features.
It's fine. Maybe a little more layout polish? It's a little awkward that you need to scroll to see key info. For example, a particularly noisy section is cut off by the bottom of the screen on my monitor.
Lots of stuff I don't care about, like company logos. Cluttered 
Discord server
Not sure
Tutorials
Website is a bit slow sometimes.
First impression is a bit messy, but I do like the interactive code thingy
The documentation isn't nearly as searchable as dpldocs.info
old site was better
Default examples are useless for anybody who is not coming from a higher level programming languages. They show no "D is like X" the language you come from. It instantly dumps people into D idioms. No news section on the front page. Blogs are great for C++/C etc programmers but have little value for people starting with the language.
Nothing
GUI library
Its fine
Seems like most of the useful information is there, might be missing like where D is going (what is expected to happen to in the future)
N/A
A little intimidating. Would be good to take inspiration from Python docs in terms of new user friendliness
- Better intro for first time users, I mean just take a look at Crystals | Rust | Nim homepage.
I cannot found language usage. ex) cookbooks
Improved forum mechanics.
Nothing to dislike or like, it is just a website
the install deb/install rpm buttons could be changed to just a download button
i like languages similar ruby language
it does not belong to the world's best programming language.
The section on industry proven is distracting to new-comers and takes away from a good first impression. It can be placed lower on the page.
No complaints
The forum is very barebones and lackluster, it should be upgraded with some fancy features seen on most social media.
Spec isn't maintained well enough. 
Needs a better code.dlang.org.
Forum summary views don't always update correctly. I would like to see a heading for each forum topic, then a threaded view of the posts if I want to view that topic. Now I can have one or the other, bu threaded view for posts makes seeing all topics a pain. 
List of features open source projects which use D in an idiomatic way. Latest changes in D and Phobos.
The fact that the SSL certs are often out of date and Firefox on CentOS 6 can't load some of the pages.  Namely: https://tour.dlang.org/
it changes
The design / layout is very archaic and not super easy to read. It's not very marketable compare with https://kotlinlang.org/ The forums are actually a mailing list - no edit / delete post, etc...
I cannot easily find pages I want to view.
Front page is too full and messy. More very simple examples. 
nothing is really up to date
The website imo should  focus on mainly advertising the parts that are most likely to be where the visitor get their answer: - Downloads - Documenta - Forum - dlang Tour - dub - other:    - licensing    - D foundation    - Vision document
There is too much going on on the front page.
don't know — but definitely keep the edit and run demo thing!
need simplification. To many unneeded information
Table of contents of the language reference has no structure or order.
@system is never explained
The site itself is fine. Just my points about the documentation above: would be nice to have more real world and intermediate examples. Also: would be nice to post comments and/or own examples right on the documentation for a function/method/class.
Idiomatic D examples on the front page isn't understandable by users of another C-like languages
I don't have any big complaints about dlang.org.
no volatile. far from bare metal
i do not like the bright style.
Wiki is not upto date
does not provide information on dlang development infrastructure (ci, build system, ...)
nothing
forum
What to see some news about language/Phobos changes on the main page. And links to articles, blogs etc.
Mostly its ok. May be add new updates on code.dlang.org
The home page design is heavy and crowded, and I think the tagline is confusing.
No comment
It looks a little scattered, design-wise.  The company logos feel like ads taking up the center stage.  Some big calls to action like on the python page would be better ("get started" "download" "docs" "jobs")
Visual information such as figures, graphs and photos.
news elements often feel under the fold, but I often go straight to the forums anyway.
stability and design. I saw site was down several times. And its design is good but not prefessional
Some things, like how to integrate with C++ (for some parts), are not always found where you'd think. You know about them only if you've happened to read the correct blog, Dconf talk or forum post.
I think the website should look with Learn immediately after who uses D and be bigger and the documentation just below also quite big, the rest of news and community should follow all the way down but smaller, not because it is not important, just because what you want is the most accessible and fast way to start, the rest can wait: make Learn section bigger than the rest.
-
Not much
Nothing
the forum could be more modern, seems ancient
Documentation feels spread out: across 3 top-level categories: learn, documentation and resources. the 'feature overview' is useless, but the 'tour' is useful yet not listed under documentation Articles and the tour seem to be very useful, provide more topical high-level guidances, yet somehow these feel second class. Maybe due to the navigational structure, or because I don't trust that the information is up to date.  
\
code.dlang.org could really use some work to make it more easily usable, e.g., hierarchical categories, package ranking, etc. Other that that, I really do not use the webpage at all, so it is hard for me to say.
MORE D-MAN!
different parts have different style (not uniform design)
nothing, I hardly ever use it
Large submenus at the top bar, so you have to click twice to get to eg. the specification or phobos docs (this is a minor complaint)
lack of roadmap
Needs more examples and better documentation/tutorials
There are some special articles, sometimes mentioned in the forum, about general concepts they are not so easy to find. Example: https://dlang.org/articles/d-array-article.html
Nothing
It's hard to tell since I am well accustomed to it by now.
D gems list should be 10 times bigger. Short working examples on (almost) every case. Again.
The 'forum' is not a forum. 
Everything is pretty good.
Aesthetics maybe. It looks very busy.
Unattractive, dated design ad-hoc structure small search box
Nothing, I like it.
simple and clear examples. The current examples are too high level and unlikely to attract  newcomers. What is D really good at? examples on interfacing with C for example. 
Twitter feed just adds visual noise
Many useful links are buried under dropdown menus.  We should examine if we're properly surfacing the most popular options.
gui libraries
searching: it opens way too many windows. Instant, in-site search would be better. 
not always easy to find related info e.g. wiki, formum posts gh repos etc
Access to the documentation should be front and center
it is ok
I mildly dislike that dlang.org is orientated towards promoting the language to potential new users, with the main technical documentation not immediately available from the main dlang.org domain. I accept this is probably necessary considering the small condition of the D community.
It's to busy. Example code should be center stage. There isn't even a link to the blog 
a little bit amateurish
Library documentation is minimal. Library informationalists should be more
The latest front page of dlang.org is too busy, and too long. The important pages: download, documentation, forum, bug tracker, are all linked at the top, which is good. The code sample is nice. Everything else seems to be needless clutter. The slogan makes me cringe -- it says almost nothing about what D actually is. The commercial logos seem to be there only to justify D's existence to the naysayers. I don't even know what's on the second half of the page; pretty much never bothered to scroll down there. The news items, which is cut off on the first page in my browser, look too wordy and makes me not want to bother reading it.
The library documentation could be improved.
The server is constantly going down or slow. Especially the forums and dub server. The front page is better than most langs (Ruby, Python, Go, Nodejs). But the sections in the middle are too verbose (News, Learn, Community, Documentation, Contribute, Packages). The "Fast code, fast." should be a link to a "Why choose D" page.
It's pretty good. Maybe it's a little bit busy, and maybe the focal priorities are a little clumsy?
nothing
Nothing in particular, but I don't visit the website.  Generally I rely on google search results.
Not much, it is pretty good.
It would be greatly improved if there was the analog of a phrasebook, that had a substantial collection of ways to perform common programming tasks in a D-like way.
It could be made to display better in lynx and links browsers.
ddoc functionality to create html looks like dlang.org
Nothing
Dunno...have to look at it closely...but it does look good though
More comprehensive install info for 3rd party compilers on the download page.
I never go there
Too slow in China
The D snippets could be simpler
None
It looks incredibly busy, but I don't really know what could be improved.
The 'used by' and 'dconf' banners seem almost out of place, and incongruous with the other, more minimal elements.
It's not bad. 
A better forum that allows editing of posts, with syntax highlighting for code. I don't know how a programming board can exist without allowing for code snippets to be posted with syntax highlighting.
I want information on the development tool more easily noticed.
I don't remember ever landing on the front page of dlang.org
A bit confusing for newbies. Prime focus seems to be on CT, not RT.
It's fine, I rarely look at it as I just go directly to forums.
a proper forum instead of NNTP wrapper would be nice
It doesn't communicate the state of long-standing issues in the language, such as GC performance and GC involvement in phobos.
Major D news and development directions could be more prominently displayed.
Nothing really
front page examples are comically complicated
Comparison with go, rust
weird font,
The 'runnable' code snippets could be a little longer and be more diverse than it is now.
it would be nice if the forum  and the twitter activity wold be more visible
It's dreadfully difficult to do more than heckle from the back seats here - working out properly how to market and present D is very difficult.   For what it's worth, D seems to me to be a secret weapon that a very highly skilled and tightly managed team or company can use to perform at a much higher level than their peers. I don't think the average developer should consider it - they're better off learning Java better, or whatever.  In this light, the primary purpose of dlang.org the landing page should probably be to prove to interested but rationally sceptical visitors that D isn't just another fun language design game a small team is playing, but a real, solid, reliable, industrial strength solution that responsible companies choose for production work. It gestures at this with the 'Industry Proven' section, but it's not clear (to the outsider) whether it's just e.g. one guy in Netflix playing with D for some automation, etc.   You could turn these logos into tight case studies that the (above) users would be able to empathise with and take seriously, and it would be much, much more compelling to them.
Saw some issues on contributors page
I'm ok with it
on the frontpage only the current stable versionsnumber is shown, not the current beta versionsnumber
None
Front page is a good starting point, but the second level content is uneven in terms of level of granularity, expected knowledge, and writing quality. eg. The links behind "explore major features" vs "set up your editor".
Documentation of Phobos is hard to read. Forum is overly negative.
Some code examples on the front page are too complex.
That is all right
It is an excellent site. But it needs to communicate SPEED. Most people do not have a problem with GC; entrenched C and C++ programmers have a problem (perceived or real) with GC. If D is going to continue to target these people, it needs to, on the front page or with clear links, demonstrate the SPEED of D in many typical contexts for these C and C++ programmers, while showing them the compilation time, build system, package management, and code concision benefits.
More basic tutorials for beginners to programming. Could be a good demographic for D.
prefer the way the docs work on Adam's site.
Better learning resources.
A search feature for phobos like http://dpldocs.info
Seems outdated
Me gusta dlang.org
To much targeting c++ crowd
nothing, really
Takes two clicks instead of one click to get to the bugzilla page. Why do I have to click on "Issues" then click on another link to get to issues?
Still a little old school
Could feel more alive. For example with a preview of a blog or new packages on code.dlang.org
None
primitive (old-style) forum
Dub packages need more focus
too much noise,  for example "Industry Proven" should be in the bottom or in other pages.
Maybe a job section, although I fear it's too early for that.
seems ok
It's sometimes not up to date, i.e. promoting the submission deadline days after it has passed
don't know
Better search
The forum interface doesn't support syntax highlighting / markdown / any other styling
too much noise in the way
Dlang.org is the standard to which we should hold other languages and tool chains. 
It's pretty ugly. 
Nothing in particular.
You go to website to download or to learn about the language, if you use D you rarely go to website, so it needs to focus on new people, managers, and learning stuff only
The fact that the various parts of it are down so much (such as the tour).
Obsolete forum
The who is using D logos and DConf advert look a bit like advertising spam
It would be nice if the Downloads page contained a link to a Personal Package Archive for installing different versions of D on Ubuntu signed with developer keys.
Nothing
It's incredible hard to contribute to due to ddoc usage!
The dub manual should be included in the offline version. External links aside, there are plenty of links in the Phobos docs which refer to an online URL rather than the offline file.
Some examples feel unrealistic and try to promote the 'functional one-liner' style too hard. Such style is nice for simple snippets, but for anything more complex you'll be back to for loops anyway.
Cannot say.
The front-page examples are often too complex looking at first glance.
A bit vague, doesn't mention GC anywhere, better to get that out of the way up front.
Specifically with the dub packages, sometimes it's slow or unavailable (though I think there are mirrors and dub is getting smarter)
Searching with Google, a local full text index might be better
no
I don't use it that often, to be honest.
examples feel overwhelming 
The forum's style (mailing list displayed as forums) is a really weird way to do it. I've also seen a lot of forum posts in ddg searches that don't exist anymore, which is frustrating.
not much.
Would like more clear step-by-step guide for install, build, run hello world (win32 and console) apps, using both visual studio and visual studio code
My small complaint would be that on https://dlang.org/phobos/index.html the left hand std, core, etc are not expanded by default, I exclusively browse phobos documentation by jumping to the module I want to see with that
Nothing
The forums really need to be something better than a mailing list! It's a bit embarrassing not to be able to highlight D code on our own website...
Nothing.
There are some important things a single click away, like the official blog and the downloads page, which is good, but then there are other just-as-important-things that are not, like the wiki and the forums.  I always forget that the big and prominent "Learn" link, next to the logo, takes me to tour.dlang.org, when I really just want to go to the Learn forum.
Remove dead projects. 
Having to click twice to get to GitHub, Issues, Forum, Wiki
A dark mode (css) for the documentation
 
metaprogramming examples
Too much self-congratulation and not enough objective info.
A  lot of valuable information is scattered around, in the wiki for example, and should be distilled and inserted in the main site. Very very poor informations about the ecosystem, like Visual-D relegated into 'resources', or 'dub' buried into the packages page, along with it's documentation.
The style is very dated visually. The messages about the language are somewhat generic and not necessarily really supported by the reality of using the language at the moment. The forum is really crippled by its insistence on being a view on a mailing list. Threads regularly split up and you cannot edit nor delete posts. Please improve it.
design of the documentation is terrible
Can't see "Latest announcements" and "Active discussions" on mobile
It could be more attractive, and modern.
i really miss a quicknav section at the bottom of the page
Search features are lacking and hard to use
It's a little busy.
Weird/complex examples of D usage (from C user perspective).
Overall, I don't have any particular complaints about it, but I also don't use it much. Even when reading the documentation, I'm more likely to just open the source code locally than dlang.org, and I use the mailing list interface to the newsgroup rather than forum.dlang.org. I'm sure that the spec does need some clarifications and some fleshing out, but it's decent. We could probably use more in the way of tutorial stuff, since that's completely lacking, but someone would have to write it, and I think that there are a couple of sites geared toward that. They're not the sort of thing I go looking for though, since I'm not a newbie.
The blog should be more prominently featured. Emphasize community. Highlight 2-3 marquee application. What’s up with a giant code/example taking up half the page? Docs docs docs.  
The search feature is terrible and sometimes it's not so obvious where you find certain information, could be combined with a solution for the first one.
Nothing
The first stuff i should see is some super simple code, not a mixin haxory.
Horrible theming.
Navigating the dropdowns to find stuff is a bit confusing.
nothing at all
standard library is too poor in contrast golang
It's difficult to get to Dub's documentation without knowing the URL.
Needs a redesign, aesthetically wise (it is getting old). And maybe split it in "new comers" and "experienced" section, so either group can access faster the relevant resources.
Nothing in particular...
Add benchmarks about relative performance.
I don't know
It's to hard to find the changelog, which is one of the most interesting ascets.
The example program on the front page is badly formatted and uses a lot of jargon like "alias this" that will confuse new users. Needs to have something that better demonstrates the language's ability.
Uptime
I don't know

Too much clutter
